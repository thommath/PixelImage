# PixelImage

A fun project to create dot art from images.

## How it works

This project creates a few thousand circles and renders them with instanced rendering offset by noise to recreate a image. The purpose of the project is to create art as well as a learning exercise. It is currently hosted on [https://pixelimage.mashaogthomas.no](https://pixelimage.mashaogthomas.no)
